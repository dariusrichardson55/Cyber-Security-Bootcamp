# CyberSecurity-Bootcamp
<h1>Professional Statement</h1>
I am a motivated and detail-oriented Computer Science graduate from the University of Lincoln with hands-on experience as a Junior RPA Engineer, specialising in Automation Anywhere, UiPath, and Blue Prism to streamline business processes. Naturally technically minded, I am proficient across many technologies and systems and can learn extremely quickly.  Having identified a career path within tech, particularly cybersecurity, I am currently participating in a full-time, government-funded Skills Bootcamp in cybersecurity to help achieve this. I am completing real-world projects to further my knowledge and understanding. I now seek employment opportunities that would allow for ongoing professional development, ideally in an earn-and-learn capacity.

<h1>Portfolio</h1>
I have made a Cybersecurity Portfolio to showcase the tasks and projects that I have done during my training in a CyberSecurity Bootcamp. The Bootcamp has provided me with the necessary knowledge and skills such as:


<ul>
<li>Keeping updated with the latest cyberattacks happening to other organisations.</li>
<li>Created risk scenarios to visualise what an attacker would do to infiltrate technologies.</li>
<li>Using Tenable Nessus scan, to find vulnerabilities in the organisation’s network systems.</li>
<li>Being able to identify and resolve security breaches.</li> 
</ul>
